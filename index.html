		<h2>DISCLAIMER:</h2> 
		<p>
		This app's creation is in no way associated with Rap Genius.<br>
		Rap Genius, from an email conversation with someone from their team, <br>
		appears to be fine with this application as long as it remains free.

		Unfortunately, this app was removed from the market place due to a DMCA complaint by the NMPA, 
		citing copyrighted lyrics from another lyrics site (not Rap Genius). 
		</p>

		<h2>Installation Instructions</h2><br>
		Two choices for installation:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Easiest way to install the app is to just grab the <i>.apk</i> and install it onto your device (uncheck the option that blocks installing apks in the <i>settings</i>).</li>
			<li>Download the entire source and import it into Eclipse*, then:
			<ul>
				<li>Build/Compile/Run it on your device,</li>
				<li>Export it to an <i>.apk</i> yourself (<b>File</b> -> </b>Export..). </li>
				Exporting would require generating a key store.
			</ul>
			<li>Try and import the project to Android Studio, and build it that way. You'll have to modify the build.gradle however.
		</ol>
		*Be sure to remove the exclude screenshots from Eclipse after downloading.<br><br>

		If you had installed this app from the market, you should probably remove that version before installing this
		to avoid any problems.<br>

		<h2>Notes</h2><br>
		Feel free to contribute any new features or better implementations.<br>
		Probably won't keep it monitored too closely so let me know if you find any bugs.<br>
